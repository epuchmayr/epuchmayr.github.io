          <h2>Hootsuite</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> was an incredible journey to be a part of. I joined as a
            front-end developer and helped create the dashboard and what would
            later become the social media streams, publisher, and composer. I
            was there for over a decade and worked on a variety of features,
            here are some of the highlights.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h3>Layout</h3>
          <p>
            The first version of Hootsuite (Brightkit as it was initially
            called) was a vertical scrolling beast. This is a very hybrid style
            approach, including strong header and footer elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time the team was so small I had complete ownership over the
            frontend layout. I would take the PSD, slice it up in Photoshop and
            then figure out how to best implement the design. I used a modified
            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/" target="_blank">BEM</a>
            style to handle all the colours and sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Funny how you see patterns repeat with utility classes coming back
            in the form of
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a>
            albeit much easier/cleaner with pre-processing and intellisense.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/branding_preview_01.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Eventually we created a vertical scrolling "stream" layout, I got to
            figure out rounded corners before border-radius was a thing (lots of
            absolute positioning).
          </p>
          <img src="./images/legacy_streams.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            I went and updated the layout to flexbox once support was high
            enough amongst our enterprise users. It was always tough to be
            governed by the number of internet explorer users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more current version of the streams is horizontal scrolling with
            inner panels. Moving the tabs to a side menu was a huge change and
            required a lot of reworking of the existing code. And because this
            was a rolling update, the old and new code had to coexist.

          <h3>Legacy Maintenance Pages</h3>
          <p>
            Written before css animations were a thing. These showcase the early
            make-it-happen attitude when working at a start-up. Look at those
            old-school shiny brand logos.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's animated gifs and fun jquery that moves the backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep these pages lightweight I kept them almost completely self
            contained, the particle library even japanese translations are
            included in the one file.

          <h3>Themes</h3>
          <p>
            While themes were something we always wanted it ended up being very
            tricky to handle early on. In the end I was juggling 3 different CSS
            folders full of duplicate files, once the project got larger this
            became unfeasible to maintain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, we reduced to one theme and the users didn't seem to
            mind. The lesson is, check with the users, maybe you've implemented
            something they don't even want.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now with CSS variables and js context this would be much easier to
            implement.

          <h3>User Interface</h3>
          <p>
            Not only did the dashboard change from pages to an SPA (single page
            app), the design updated from skeuomorphism to flat to a
            semi-brutalist. These were always challenging updates as legacy code
            had to update while creating the newer components we wanted to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through all of this it had to be internally testable and wrapped in
            feature flags. When operating in this manner for a certain grace
            period we are essentially doubling the CSS and more. This can
            quickly bloat your code base if cleanup is also not taken into
            consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution I settled on was a top level class that informs the
            interface/components. This way the styles are consistently handled
            like a boolean and cleanup can be completed much faster.

          <h3>Design System / Brand Refresh</h3>
          <p>
            After creating an internal styleguide and running into many
            technical issues we eventually migrated to Storybook as it had
            finally matured to include all the features we were looking for.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/design_system_storybook.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            I always took on the task of updating the legacy sections to keep
            them from falling into disrepair. The largest feature was streams,
            although another team had ownership, they were usually too busy
            working on a larger feature (Inbox) and were happy to let me take
            that particular task.
          </p>
          <p>
            I saw this as a great opportunity to visually enhance the main
            section that many users encounter first after login.
